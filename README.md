Chinese Brain Atlas

This brain atlas, including T1, high angular resolution diffusion image (HARDI), and resting-functional MRI, were created based on large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) and Bayesian atlas estimation approaches [1,2]. When creating the atlases, we combined the two approaches and integrated both T1 and HARDI information of adults aged from 22 to 79 years. The atlas includes structural, diffusion, and functional images as well as brain functional and deep white matter tract parcellation labels.
The structural image (T1) and DTI show coherent gray and white matter structures. The label image includes both functional and white matter tract parcellation.
